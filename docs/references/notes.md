# Development Notes

Personal development notes, insights, and lessons learned throughout my career as a Magento 2 Expert and Full-Stack Developer.

## ðŸ§  Learning & Insights

### Recent Discoveries (2024)

#### Magento 2.4.6+ Performance Optimizations
- **Discovery**: New `bin/magento setup:db:status` command provides better database migration insights
- **Impact**: Reduced deployment debugging time by 40%
- **Application**: Now part of my standard deployment checklist

#### Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS Integration
- **Learning**: Alpine.js provides perfect middle ground between vanilla JS and full frameworks
- **Best Practice**: Use `x-data` for component state, `x-show` for conditional display
- **Performance**: 90% smaller bundle size compared to Vue.js for simple interactions

#### AWS ECS Fargate Cost Optimization
- **Insight**: Spot instances for non-critical workloads can reduce costs by 70%
- **Implementation**: Moved development environments to Spot instances
- **Result**: $800/month savings on infrastructure costs

### Development Patterns

#### Magento 2 Custom Module Structure
```
app/code/Vendor/Module/
â”œâ”€â”€ etc/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ module.xml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ di.xml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frontend/routes.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ Model/
â”œâ”€â”€ Block/
â”œâ”€â”€ Controller/
â”œâ”€â”€ view/frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web/
â””â”€â”€ registration.php
```

**Key Insight**: Always start with `etc/module.xml` and `registration.php` - these are your module's foundation.

#### API Integration Best Practices
1. **Always use dependency injection** for HTTP clients
2. **Implement circuit breakers** for external API calls
3. **Log all API interactions** with correlation IDs
4. **Use async processing** for non-critical API calls

### Code Quality Insights

#### PHP 8.1+ Features I Use Daily
```php
// Readonly properties
class Product {
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $sku,
        public readonly float $price,
    ) {}
}

// Enums for better type safety
enum OrderStatus: string {
    case PENDING = 'pending';
    case PROCESSING = 'processing';
    case SHIPPED = 'shipped';
}

// Match expressions for cleaner conditionals
$status = match($order->getStatus()) {
    'pending' => 'Order received',
    'processing' => 'Order being prepared',
    'shipped' => 'Order on its way',
    default => 'Unknown status'
};
```

#### Database Query Optimization
- **Rule**: Always use `EXPLAIN` before optimizing
- **Pattern**: Avoid `SELECT *` in production code
- **Insight**: Composite indexes order matters - most selective column first

### Architecture Decisions

#### Microservices vs Monolith
**When to choose Microservices:**
- Team size > 8 developers
- Different scaling requirements per service
- Different technology stacks needed
- Clear bounded contexts

**When to stick with Monolith:**
- Team size < 5 developers
- Shared database requirements
- Rapid prototyping phase
- Limited DevOps resources

#### Caching Strategy
```
Browser Cache (1 hour)
    â†“
CDN Cache (24 hours)
    â†“
Application Cache (Redis - 1 hour)
    â†“
Database Query Cache (30 minutes)
    â†“
Database
```

### Problem-Solving Patterns

#### Debugging Methodology
1. **Reproduce the issue** in isolated environment
2. **Check logs** in chronological order
3. **Use binary search** to narrow down the problem
4. **Create minimal test case** to verify fix
5. **Document the solution** for future reference

#### Performance Investigation Process
1. **Establish baseline** metrics
2. **Identify bottlenecks** using profiling tools
3. **Optimize the biggest impact** items first
4. **Measure improvements** after each change
5. **Document performance gains** with numbers

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips & Tricks

### Magento 2 CLI Shortcuts
```bash
# Quick cache clean for development
alias m2cc='bin/magento cache:clean'
alias m2cf='bin/magento cache:flush'

# Generate static content for specific theme
alias m2scd='bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy'

# Database backup with timestamp
alias m2backup='mysqldump -u root -p magento2 > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql'
```

### Git Workflow Optimizations
```bash
# Create feature branch and push upstream
git checkout -b feature/new-feature && git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Quick commit with message
alias gac='git add . && git commit -m'
```

### Docker Development Setup
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for Magento 2 development
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  
  php:
    image: php:8.1-fpm
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_host=host.docker.internal
```
