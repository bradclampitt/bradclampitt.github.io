## Documentation Tab - Best Usage
The Documentation tab is perfect for standalone reference materials that you want to access quickly:

### Technical Documentation
- api-reference.md - API endpoints, parameters, response formats
- troubleshooting.md - Common issues and solutions you've encountered
- setup.md - Environment setup guides, configuration steps
- getting-started.md - Quick start guides for technologies you work with

### Personal Knowledge Base
- notes.md - General development notes, tips, code snippets
- documentation.md - Your personal documentation standards
- changelog.md - Personal changelog of skills learned, certifications earned

### Quick Reference Guides
- magento-commands.md - Frequently used Magento CLI commands
- aws-snippets.md - Common AWS configurations and commands
- git-workflows.md - Your preferred Git workflows and commands

**Example Structure:**
```text
docs/references/
├── README.md                 # Overview of your documentation
├── magento-best-practices.md # Magento development standards
├── aws-architecture.md       # Cloud architecture patterns
├── troubleshooting.md         # Common issues & solutions
└── code-snippets.md          # Reusable code patterns
```

## Portfolio Tab - Best Usage
The Portfolio tab is ideal for project-based documentation where each folder represents a complete project or category:

### Project Categories
- magento-modules/ - Your custom Magento extensions with detailed READMEs
- web-development/ - Full-stack web projects
- system-architecture/ - Infrastructure and architecture projects
- management-projects/ - Leadership and management initiatives
- client-work/ - Anonymized client project case studies

**Each Portfolio Folder Should Include:**
```text
portfolio/magento-modules/
├── README.md              # Overview of all your Magento modules
├── wine-knowledge/        # Individual module folders
│   ├── README.md         # Detailed module documentation
│   ├── screenshots/      # Visual examples
│   └── code-samples/     # Key code snippets
└── wine-pairings/
    ├── README.md
